I am a plant ecophysiologist and ecosystem ecologist, interested in the environmental sensitivity of plant and ecosystem functioning, specially in terms of water and carbon fluxes.  My research has focused on  (1) the quantification of tree and ecosystem water use at different spatiotemporal scales, (2) inter- and intraspecific variability of plant functional responses to drought, (3) the mechanisms and consequences of drought-induced tree mortality, (4) ecosystem carbon cycling and greenhouse gas emissions and (5) the use of large ecophysiological databases to understand global patterns in plant drought responses.
