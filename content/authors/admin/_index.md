I am a forest ecosystem ecophysiologist and ecohydrologist, interested in plant water and carbon economy and how it influences forest functioning and vulnerability in a context of global change. I have made relevant contributions on (1) the quantification of tree water use at different spatiotemporal scales, (2) how trees and forests respond to drought, specially with regard to water use and growth, (3) the role of woodlands in the carbon cycle, (4) the mechanisms and consequences of drought-induced tree mortality and (5) big data and the global functioning of woody plants.
