  volume = {278},
  abstract = {The Vallcebre research catchments are representative of Mediterranean mountain areas with spontaneous afforestation by Pinus sylvestris as a consequence of the abandonment of agriculture since the 1950s. In this context, transpiration, rainfall interception and internal fluxes in a Scots pine patch have been monitored. This paper presents the results obtained on temporal variability of these water fluxes. The result underline the importance of rainfall interception losses, representing about 24% of the bulk rainfall, and their high temporal variability depending on the meteorological conditions and on rainfall event characteristics. Soil water content has been found to be a limiting factor for tree transpiration during summer periods, even in the studied area where the annual rainfall exceeds the reference evapotranspiration.},
