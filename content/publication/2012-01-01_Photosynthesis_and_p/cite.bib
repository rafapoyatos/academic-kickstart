  volume = {100},
  abstract = {1. Arctic vegetation tends to be spatially heterogeneous and can have large areas of mixed ‘transition zone’ vegetation between stands dominated by a single or few species. If plant photosynthesis and growth within these transition zones differs significantly from main vegetation stands, and if transition zones are not considered when extrapolating stand-level findings to larger scales in space, then transition zones will provide considerable error to landscape-level estimates of gross primary productivity (GPP).},
