  abstract = {Tree stems exchange CO2, CH4 and N2O with the atmosphere but the magnitudes, patterns and drivers of these greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes remain poorly understood. Our understanding mainly comes from static-manual measurements, which provide limited information on the temporal variability and magnitude of these fluxes. We measured hourly CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes at two stem heights and adjacent soils within an upland temperate forest. We analyzed diurnal and seasonal variability of fluxes and biophysical drivers (i.e., temperature, soil moisture, sap flux). Tree stems were a net source of CO2 (3.80 ± 0.18 µmol m−2 s−1; mean ± 95% CI) and CH4 (0.37 ± 0.18 nmol m−2 s−1), but a sink for N2O (−0.016 ± 0.008 nmol m−2 s−1). Time series analysis showed diurnal temporal correlations between these gases with temperature or sap flux for certain days. CO2 and CH4 showed a clear seasonal pattern explained by temperature, soil water content and sap flux. Relationships between stem, soil fluxes and their drivers suggest that CH4 for stem emissions could be partially produced belowground. High-frequency measurements demonstrate that: a) tree stems exchange GHGs with the atmosphere at multiple time scales; and b) are needed to better estimate fluxes magnitudes and understand underlying mechanisms of GHG stem emissions.},
