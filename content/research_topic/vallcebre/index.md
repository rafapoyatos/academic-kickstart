My research activities focused on forest evaporative fluxes comprise my PhD studies, developed in the context of ecohydrological processes in Mediterranean mountain catchments. The main research questions I addressed were:

How can we better measure transpiration of trees and forests? Differences in wood structure can impact the mesurement of tree transpiration using sap flow methods. I have showed that radial patterns of sap flow in oaks with ring-porous wood are necessary to quantify transpiration from single-point measurements. More recently, we also quantified the methodological errors in thermal dissipation sap flow measurements arising from the variability in data processing procedures. In the first global assessment of sap flow calibrations, we showed that the most employed sap flow methods consistently underestimate water transport rates in woody stems, although all methods were well-suited to describe environmental responses. 

What are the ecohydrological implications of species-specific differences in forest transpiration? Within the framework of forest expansion after agricultural abandonment, I showed lower transpiration in oak forests compared to pine stands, although the latter were more sensitive to drought. These results bear important implications for the hydrological regime under the current decreasing dominance of pine forests as a result of land-use legacies and global change because sustained water use by oaks can further reduce runoff during summer.

How can we model and extrapolate forest evaporative fluxes in time and space? We showed that seasonal and interannual variability of pine transpiration is not well captured by ecosystem water balance models, either empirical or mechanistic, especially under drought conditions. For spatially heterogeneous forested landscapes, we also found that remote sensing-based models of evapotranspiration perform better with high spatial resolution imaging (LANDSAT) compared to coarser-scale MODIS imaging.
