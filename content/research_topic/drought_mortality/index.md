This was my main research topic during my initial postdoctoral period at CREAF and involved
designing, setting-up and managing complex field instrumentation to study the ecophysiological
processes and effects of drought-induced forest decline and tree mortality in terms of carbon
and water fluxes. 
Here, we addressed the following research questions, using Scots pine
as the main model species, in the context of several national and UK-funded projects. We showed
that canopy defoliation and persistent hydraulic impairment limits gas exchange and results in
heavily depleted non-structural carbohydrates reserves in Scots pine, which typically leads to
drought-induced mortality. We have also documented how root rot infection impaired growth,
starch reserves and hydraulic function, although it is not directly associated with tree
defoliation. Defoliation effects at the tree level could not be predicted directly from effects at
the twig- or root-levels. Collectively, these results highlight the complex interactions between
biotic agents and plant water and carbon economy under extreme drought.

How are ecosystem carbon fluxes affected by drought-induced tree mortality? We also
investigated the consequences of Scots pine mortality for forest ecosystem functioning, by
comparing the ecophysiological responses of Scots pine and Holm oak, the potentially
replacing species. We also showed that ecosystem CO2 fluxes will probably be altered by
this drought-driven vegetation shift, as holm oak is associated with lower soil respiration rates
than Scots pine.
