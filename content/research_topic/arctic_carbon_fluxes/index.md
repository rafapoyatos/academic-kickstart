During my postdoc at Durham University, within the framework of the 
[ABACUS project](https://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/abacus 'ABACUS'  ) I measured CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes in different 
subarctic vegetation types of northern Fennoscandia using automated and manual gas exchange systems.

We showed that photosynthesis of subarctic mountain birch dynamically acclimates to temperature 
variations within 5-7 days and that whole-branch respiration shows a strong phenological pattern. 
This dynamic acclimation of photosynthesis implies that longer growing seasons and the alleviation of 
thermal constraints on photosynthesis due to global warming both contribute to the increase in carbon 
sequestration by subarctic trees in polar tree-lines.

In subarctic mires, we showed that growing-season CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes of tundra vegetation are very 
well predicted by leaf area and spectral indexes, regardless of vegetation type, but photosynthetic 
light responses are mediated by air temperature and vapour pressure deficit1. Therefore, although 
upscaling tundra carbon fluxes from plot to landscape can rely on simple vegetation structural parameters, 
we have shown that microclimatic influences and patterns induced by environmental gradients and/or 
community structure cannot be overlooked. Overall, these findings have increased our understanding 
of global change-induced trends in carbon sequestration by heterogeneous tundra.
